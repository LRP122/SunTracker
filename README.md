# SunTracker

SunTracker is a iot project designed to find how much solar power can be generated by creating algorightms and systems that tilt the panels in a ideal way towards the sun.

## Hardware

- Microcontroller is a ESP32
- To measure Current we use a INA129
- The solar panel is a 60mmx60mm 3V 0.3W panel
- To tilt the panel we use a simple servo motor

## Software

- The project is written in C++, using esp-idf as a build tool
- The data transfer will be happening over MQTT to keep track of the data
